In this work, we address the Network Slice Design problem. This is an original problem arising from the optimization of end-to-end communication networks using fifth-generation (5G) radio access technology. To address the underlying optimization problem, we propose an open-access framework based on a math-heuristic that encompasses control-plane and data-plane separation and novel mapping and decomposition dimensions influencing the placement and interconnection of slices. Our framework also incorporates flexible functional splitting, with possibly different splitting for different slices while taking into consideration dependency factors such as varying network latency and data volume throughout the virtual access networks.
